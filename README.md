GitHub Project Link: https://github.com/YazAtth/Cascadia_Group21

1. Run the "Main.java" file or the "Cascadia_Group21-2.0" .jar file located in 
   the project directory root.
2. As we want a Bot vs Bot game: enter the number of players as 0 and the number of bots as 2.
3. Enter the names of the two bots.
4. You will then be presented with a game tutorial screen and the order in which the two bots
    will play in. Press "ENTER" to continue.
5. The game will then begin and you will be able to see the game board and the first move made
   by the first bot.
   You wil also be able to see:
   1. The bots current score
   2. The time taken for the bot to make a decision in milliseconds (to prove each turn takes less than 5 seconds).
   3. The biome(s) of the habitat tile being placed and co-ordinate of where it was placed.
   4. The wildlife token type of the token being placed and the co-ordinate of where it was placed.
   5. If a nature token was spent.
   6. The number of nature tokens.
6. Typing "2" will display the 4 Habitat Tiles and Wildlife Tokens the bot had to choose from before making a decision.
7. Pressing "ENTER" will cause the next bot to make a turn and information about their turn will be displayed.
8. Pressing "1" will hide the "turn-by-turn descriptions" and in the case where all of the players are bots: will fast-forward the game to the end.
9. When the game ends: each player will be ranked with their score next to their game.
